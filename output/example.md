Your design should be **<u>clearly</u>** drawn on the next page within
the rectangular shape. Average parking spot size is 9’ x 18’, but you
will not be using that entire space and the size will vary. You do not
need to submit a full color version. Feel free to make any necessary
comments at the bottom. Upload both pages of this document with
signatures and proposed design using the “[<u>Design
Submission</u>”](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRPp5MCzEuijQEryyutSUSuBiaDTHbeYosnKQbUZ2RMXY_HA/viewform?usp=header)
link on the
[<u>novi-sanp.com/parking</u>](http://www.novi-sanp.com/parking) website
by July 21, 2025.

You must pay for a parking spot before your design will be reviewed and
approved. Purchase your spot and your NHS parking pass and then submit
your design a[t <u>novi-sanp.com/parking</u>
**b**](http://www.novi-sanp.com/parking)**efore July 21, 2025**. Your
final painted version in the parking lot **<u>must</u>** match your
approved design.

# Student and Parent/Guardian Agreement 

I recognize, as a member of the Class of 2026, that the painting of
Senior parking spaces is a privilege and understand that Novi High
School Administration has the right to revoke this privilege at their
discretion for acts on the part of seniors negatively representing the
student body and/or violations of school policy. If I break the student
code of conduct in any way and my administrator feels an appropriate
punishment is to lose my painted parking spot, I will NOT be refunded
for the original amount paid and my spot will be painted. I have read
and agree to adhere to the design guidelines. I assume full
responsibility for my actions and behavior, and shall hold neither Novi
High School, nor Novi Community School District liable for an act or
occurrence. I realize that it is my responsibility to adhere to
regulations regarding this senior privilege.
